**pig_game.java** is the dice rolling game, Pig. Each human player is instantiated and takes turns playing against one another and a computer bot. The first player to a score of 100 wins.

**players.java** is the class used to instantiate human players and track their performance.

**database.java** is a class that inserts the performance of the human players and the computer into the tables, pig_game_winners and pig_game_player_stats, in the database, fun. I used MySQL.
