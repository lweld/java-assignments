**pig_game** contains three java files: 1) a class that plays the dice game Pig, 2) a class to instantiate players, 3) a class to write the results of the game to a database.

**FastenerHierarchy** models the hierarchy of various types of Fasteners. These classes are meant to demonstrate the use of inheritance/polymorpism in Java, plus good hierarchy design.

**PropertyHierarchy** models the hierarchy of various properties that a real estate firm sells. These classes are meant to demonstrate the use of inheritance/polymorpism in Java, plus good hierarchy design.

**calculate_pi.java** uses various formulas, primitive types, the BigDecimal class and the Ramanujan summation algorithm to calculate the value of pi. The purpose is to explore the best way to calculate pi given that computers cannot properly store large numbers. Note: the last technique allows the user to enter the number of significant digits they would like to calculate pi to. I suggest you enter 2035 and note the time it took to run (a time delta is part of this program). In 1949 the ENIAC computer took 70+ hours to calculate pi to 2,035 digits... your computer will be lightening fast in comparison!

**PizzaOrderSystem** creates a pizza based on a user's request and keeps track of the number of each type of pizza ordered.
